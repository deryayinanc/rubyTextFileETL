rubyTextFileETL
===============

Three scripts for modifying text files. Developed to overcome a proprietary systems data manipulation constratints. This particular piece of software only allowed users to manipulate data outside of the application and load back in.

Solution developed allows these "exported" text files to be text manipulated and saved to a folder called "Modified" for importing back.

A simple ETL solution that I thought would be of use to community.
